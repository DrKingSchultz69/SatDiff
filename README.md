# Satellite Image Diffusion Model: Technical Report

## Problem Statement
The Satellite Image Diffusion Model addresses several key challenges in satellite imagery processing:
1. Limited availability of high-quality satellite images
2. Need for image enhancement and super-resolution
3. Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery
4. Generation of synthetic satellite images for training and testing

## Model Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Conditional UNet
- Input: Satellite images (3 channels - RGB)
- Architecture:
  - Encoder-Decoder structure with skip connections
  - Time and class conditioning
  - Residual blocks for better gradient flow
  - Model channels: 32 (configurable)
  - Output: Denoised images or segmentation maps

#### 2. Diffusion Process
- Timesteps: 100 (configurable)
- Beta schedule: Linear from 0.0001 to 0.02
- Forward process: Gradually adds noise to images
- Reverse process: Denoises images using learned model

#### 3. Additional Features
- Super-resolution capability
- Pseudo-semantic segmentation
- Class-conditional generation

## How It Works

### 1. Training Process
1. Images are loaded and preprocessed (resized to 32x32, normalized)
2. Random timesteps are sampled
3. Noise is added to images based on timestep
4. Model predicts noise and is trained to minimize MSE loss
5. AdamW optimizer with learning rate 1e-4

### 2. Generation Process
1. Start with random noise
2. Iteratively denoise using the model
3. Apply class conditioning for specific land types
4. Output high-quality satellite images

### 3. Super-Resolution
1. Takes low-resolution input
2. Upsamples using bicubic interpolation
3. Enhances using diffusion model
4. Outputs high-resolution image

### 4. Semantic Segmentation
1. Takes input image
2. Processes through model
3. Generates segmentation mask
4. Outputs class predictions per pixel

## Real-Life Applications

3. **Land Use Classification**
   - Assist in identifying different land types
   - Support urban planning and environmental monitoring

4. **Disaster Assessment**
   - Generate before/after scenarios
   - Aid in damage assessment

## Example Dataset: EuroSAT
